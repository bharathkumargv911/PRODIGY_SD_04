# IMPLEMENTING A SUDOKU SOLVER

This program is designed for solving a game called as "SUDOKU". Sudoku is a popular mathematical and a logical game. This program has been implemented a technique called as "Backtracking". Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that is often used in data structures to solve problems recursively by trying out various possible solutions and then undoing them if they do not lead to a solution. By using this technique and Java we have implemented a program which provides the missing numbers in the sudoku game.


## About Sudoku Game

Sudoku, popular form of number game. In its simplest and most common configuration, sudoku consists of a 9 × 9 grid with numbers appearing in some of the squares. The object of the puzzle is to fill the remaining squares, using all the numbers 1–9 exactly once in each row, column, and the nine 3 × 3 subgrids. Sudoku is based entirely on logic, without any arithmetic involved, and the level of difficulty is determined by the quantity and positions of the original numbers.
